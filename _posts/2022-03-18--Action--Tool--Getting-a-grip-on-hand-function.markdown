Getting a grip on hand function

by Yale University

Humans are unparalleled in the animal kingdom in hand dexterity. We use tools, hold pens, thread needles, and more, with little thought about the challenges the nervous system faces when precisely applying forces with the fingertips. A team of researchers set out to find what it takes to grasp with our fingertips, which is crucial for human hand dexterity. Published today in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the results bring new understanding about neural control and evolution of the human hand, and potentially new ways to aid disabilities.
