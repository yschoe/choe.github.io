Gestalt psychology is a precursor of cognitive psychology, and many concepts developed in it are highly relevant to current AI research.

"Insight learning", described by Kohler, is a good example. This could be used as a new paradigm for machine learning, departing from the data-intensive, shallow understanding in deep learning. Also of note is the experiment that sparked this theory: observation of spontaneous tool construction in chimpanzees!!

BTW, my phd work was on perceptual grouping in the visual cortex, basically a gestalt theory.
