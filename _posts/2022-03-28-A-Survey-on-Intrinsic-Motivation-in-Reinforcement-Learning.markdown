A very good survey on intrinsic motivation in reinforcement learning. Intrinsic motivation is reward coming from the inside of the agent, typically unrelated with the task at hand. Also see various works by Pierre-Yves Oudeyer. [http://www.pyoudeyer.com/](http://www.pyoudeyer.com/)

A survey on intrinsic motivation in reinforcement learning

Arthur Aubret, Laetitia Matignon, Salima Hassas

The reinforcement learning (RL) research area is very active, with an important number of new contributions; especially considering the emergent field of deep RL (DRL). However a number of scientific and technical challenges still need to be addressed, amongst which we can mention the ability to abstract actions or the difficulty to explore the environment which can be addressed by intrinsic motivation (IM). In this article, we provide a survey on the role of intrinsic motivation in DRL. We categorize the different kinds of intrinsic motivations and detail for each category, its advantages and limitations with respect to the mentioned challenges. Additionnally, we conduct an in-depth investigation of substantial current research questions, that are currently under study or not addressed at all in the considered research area of DRL. We choose to survey these research works, from the perspective of learning how to achieve tasks. We suggest then, that solving current challenges could lead to a larger developmental architecture which may tackle most of the tasks. We describe this developmental architecture on the basis of several building blocks composed of a RL algorithm and an IM module compressing information.
