This is another very interesting paper, exploring sensorimotor learning. The senior author is Kevin O'Regan, who wrote several influential papers on sensorimotor basis of understanding (his model is called sensorimotor contingency theory). He even tries to explain qualia ("redness" of red, etc.) using this approach, in his earlier paper. 



 You can see that he cites my paper. Here are some related papers: [/pub/#Action](/pub/#Action).

Discovering space — Grounding spatial topology and metric regularity in a naive agent’s sensorimotor experience

In line with the sensorimotor contingency theory, we investigate the problem of the perception of space from a fundamental sensorimotor perspective. D…
