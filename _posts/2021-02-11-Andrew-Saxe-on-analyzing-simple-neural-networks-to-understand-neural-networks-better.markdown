A very interesting talk by Andrew Saxe, showing how experiments with really simple neural networks can help us better understand what's going on in these neural networks and how to improve them. 

Yesterday, I attended a symposium ([https://sites.google.com/mila.quebec/senai/home)](https://sites.google.com/mila.quebec/senai/home)) where he gave a similar talk and I found his work and his approach to be very interesting.
