This new result from neuroscience is pretty profound! This could be a possible mechanism to overcome catastrophic forgetting in deep learning.

Alexander Barnett shared a link to the group: Neuroscience.


‘Research in mice shows that neural representations of sensory information get rotated 90 degrees to transform them into memories. In this orthogonal arrangement, the memories and sensations do not interfere with one another.’
