Quote: "And none of this is to justify the silliest bits of hype: current systems aren’t conscious, they don’t understand us, reinforcement learning isn’t enough, and you can’t build human-like intelligence just by scaling up. But all these issues are peripheral from the main debate: does symbolic manipulation need to be hard-coded, or can it be learned?"
