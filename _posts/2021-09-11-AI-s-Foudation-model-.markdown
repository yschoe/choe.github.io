An article on the controversial "Foundation Models" of AI, which is argued by a group of AI researchers as the ultimate foundation and a paradigm shift in AI. 

The main idea: Train huge models (like GPT-3) and use these pretrained models to fine-tune in a task-specific manner. 
As for me, I'm a bit skeptical.
