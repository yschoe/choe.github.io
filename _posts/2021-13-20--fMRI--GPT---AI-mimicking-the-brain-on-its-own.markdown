Interesting news about a new paper that came out from MIT that compared large language models like GPT3 against human fMRI data and behavioral performance taken during language tasks and found that the language models can closely predict the neural patterns and the behavioral outcomes. 
The main paper appeared in PNAS: [https://www.pnas.org/content/118/45/e2105646118](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/45/e2105646118)
