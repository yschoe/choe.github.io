Deep insights by Daniel Kahneman on "adversarial collaboration", where two parties with opposing scientific views would each suggest experiments to invalidate the others' idea, and the challenged would test it and both will continually improve their ideas. Somewhat like GAN. 




Kahneman received the Nobel prize in Economics in 2002.

Some notable quotes:

* People don't change their minds.
* The power of reasons is an illusion. The belief will not change when the reasons are defeated. The causality is reversed. People believe the reasons because they believe in the conclusion.
* If a large and diverse body of published evidence supports a conclusion, you must believe in it. You are not allowed to believe only results that seem plausible to you.
* Adversarial collaboration is an alternative to what I call "angry scienceÂ­."
* I don't like to reduce cognitive processes to flow charts and to mathematical models. I have a strong preference for facts.
