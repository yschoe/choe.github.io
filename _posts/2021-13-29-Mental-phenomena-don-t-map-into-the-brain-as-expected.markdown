A very good essay on how neuroscientists' notion of brain and cognitive functions such as memory, perception, attention, etc. should change fundamentally! 
I've always thought that "memory" is an ill-defined notion, when used in the sense of storage and retrieval of information. When we think about what memory is for, we can link it up with a very different function of "prediction".
