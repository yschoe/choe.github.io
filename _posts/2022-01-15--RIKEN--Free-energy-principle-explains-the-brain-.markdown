Free energy principle explains how the brain works? Seems a bit of a stretch, but interesting nonetheless. 
The free energy principle has been developed by Karl Friston, and some people believe his ideas could lead to a major breakthrough in understanding the brain. As far as I understand, it is basically a Bayesian theory, but interestingly it includes a lot of emphasis on dynamics and sensorimotor function.
