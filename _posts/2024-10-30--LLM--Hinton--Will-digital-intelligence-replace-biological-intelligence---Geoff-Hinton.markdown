A very interesting talk by Geoff Hinton.

From the overview slide:

<ul>
<li> Two paradigms for intelligence : symbolic vs. neural
</li>
<li> Do chatbots like GPT-4 and Gemini really understand?
</li>
<li> Some of the threats of AI
</li>
<li> A crucial difference between digital and analog neural networks and why this difference is so scary.
</li>
</ul>

Near the end he talks about a very interesting concept: how digital computer based neural networks are immortal (we can copy and paste the weights to a new hardware, indefinitely), while biological neural networks are mortal (cannot copy). Then, he proposes "mortal computation", neural networks running on analog hardware, and how this can be much more efficient, although less powerful.
