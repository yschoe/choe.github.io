Arxiv-sanity, an excellent resource for looking for AI papers. Set up by Andrej Karpathy, senior director at Tesla, and an early contributor of the ImgeNet data set. 

You can create an account and "like" papers, and also look at recently most influential papers (past week, past month, past year), and it also has a simple recommendation function based on your likes.
