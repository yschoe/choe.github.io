This is an interesting essay on consciousness, with an emphasis on the importance of "loops". 



The main ideas are that the mind arises from a feedback loop that makes a model of itself available to itself, and without such a feedback loop there will be no consciousness. 



Some thoughts: (1) what is this model like, and what prevents an infinite regress, a model of the model of the model ..., and (2) even for feedforward circuits in the brain (e.g., the cerebellum, mentioned in the essay, and thought to be unconsciouss), isn't it possible for it to form a feedback loop, not within the brain but through the brain-body-environment loop?
