As you know, I'm very interested in tool construction and tool use. Here's an excellent book on the subject, with a focus on tool construction and tool use in animals.

Shumaker, Walkup, and Beck, "Animal Tool Behavior: The use and manufacture of tools by animals". JHU Press. 2011.



In this book, they define tool use as:

The external employment of an unattached or manipulable attached environmental object to alter more efficiently the form, postino, or condition of another object, another organism, or the user itself, when the user holds and directly manipulates the tool during or prior to use and is responsible for the proper and effective orientation of the tool.



Take a look at tool-use related papers form our lab too!
