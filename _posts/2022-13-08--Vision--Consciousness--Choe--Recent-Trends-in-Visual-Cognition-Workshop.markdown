Looks like a very interesting workshop! Kevin O'Regan's talk, especially: "The visual world as an outside memory and implications for consciousness". Two of my favorite topics: external memory, and consciousness! 



O'Regan and his colleagues' work on the sensorimotor account of consciousness and visual cognition is also (e.g., his papers on understanding the external world from the inside of an agent via sensorimotor interaction: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12959664/).](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12959664/).) See our own work: [https://yschoe.github.io/pub_topic/#Action](https://yschoe.github.io/pub_topic/#Action) .
