A good selection of topics from the recent NeurIPS conference.

What looks interesting:

1. Philosopher David Chalmers' invited talk on large language models and consciousness (this is just briefly flashed in one of the photos)!

2. Been Kim et al.'s work on Behavioral embedding for off-line multiagent behavioral analysis.

3. Language models and RL

4. Various RL papers from Berkeley.
