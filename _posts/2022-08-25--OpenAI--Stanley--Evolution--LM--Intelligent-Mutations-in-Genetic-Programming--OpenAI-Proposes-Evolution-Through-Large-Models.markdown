New research from OpenAI (senior author Ken Stanley is a good friend from grad school days) shows how evolutionary computation can be used to fine tune large language models and help them explore uncharted territories. 

Quote: 

1. The ELM method for efficiently evolving programs through LLMs.

2. A technique for improving ELMâ€™s ability to search over time by fine-tuning its LLM-based mutation operator.

3. A demonstration of ELM in a domain not included in the training data of the LLM.

4. Validation that data generated through ELM can bootstrap enhanced LLMs that offer a novel path towards open-endedness.

Choe: no need to have everything to be differentiable
