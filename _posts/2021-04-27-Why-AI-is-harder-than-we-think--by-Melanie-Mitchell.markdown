This is a good read on what is wrong with current research in AI. 

Melanie Mitchell is well known for her work on analogies (with her phd advisor Douglas Hofstadter), genetic algorithms, and many other subjects. Many years ago (~2005), I visited her lab in Portland to give a talk on analogies in the brain.
