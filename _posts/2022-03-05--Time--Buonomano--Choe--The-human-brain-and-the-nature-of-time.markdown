This is a very interesting essay by Dean Buonomano, a UCLA neuroscientist who has done a lot of research on temporal mechanisms in the brain. 

"Einstein and why the block universe is a mistake: The human brain and the nature of time"

He also has a fairly recent book on the same subject, titled "Your Brain Is a Time Machine: The Neuroscience and Physics of Time".

Reflecting back on my research, I've always been interested in time and its relation to brain and mind. 
This includes: synchrony, internal dynamics, prediction, delay, memory, external memory, consciousness, sensorimotor loop, etc.
