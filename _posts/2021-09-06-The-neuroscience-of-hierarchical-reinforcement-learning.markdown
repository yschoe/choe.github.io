Interesting neuroscience news. This may be quite relevant to hierarchical reinforcement learning. 

The researchers found that the pattern of activations for both inductive and deductive reasoning were located in a set of brain regions commonly known as "the multiple-demand (MD) system" that has been known to be involved in different kinds of cognitive challenges such as the selection of task-relevant stimuli of a current cognitive operation, swift reorganization with changing context, and separation of successive stages of task steps, which are intrinsic to the underlying mechanism for humans' flexible thoughts and problem- solving.

Robert Stonjek shared a link to the group: Neuroscience.
