An interesting talk by philosopher and cognitive scientist Andy Clark. He talks about prediction as being central to brain function, and how it plays an important role in our felt experience. 

I agree prediction is a key aspect, but I'm a bit skeptical about predictive coding (Karl Friston and others' predictive processing, active inference, etc.), which Clark seems to subscribes to.
