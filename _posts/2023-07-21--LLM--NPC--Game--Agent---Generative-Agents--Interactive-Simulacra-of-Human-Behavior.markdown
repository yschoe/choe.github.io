This is very cool! Park et al. created a small social simulation where 25 non-player characters (NPCs) were given their own personal history and social role, and allowed to expand their knowledge and relation within the simulation by interacting with each other. 

I always felt that NPCs become too hollow after all the quests are done in open world games, and something like this can help fix this.
