Interesting paper on LLMs from a philosopher's view point.



[https://philpapers.org/rec/SCHCEJ-2](https://philpapers.org/rec/SCHCEJ-2)



Here are some major points:

* Epistemic deficits in LLMs (opacity, hallucinations, etc.).

* Considerations in the field of epistemology suggesting that LLMs do not confer epistemic justification.

* Impoverished digital privacy.

* Relationships with personalized chatbots, which people see as “digital companions” or “digital persons”, blurring the lines.

* Epistemic trust in these ‘digital companions’ despite their not providing us with epistemic justification.

* Social media companies using principles in social psychology and neuroscience to manipulate chatbot users.

* The AI Megasystem Control problem.
