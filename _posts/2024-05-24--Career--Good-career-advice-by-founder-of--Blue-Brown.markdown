Good career advice!

Founder of the extremely popular and influential math youtube channel 3Blue1Brown: "What 'Follow your dreams' misses".

1. add value to others, not just to yourself

2. action precedes motivation: start doing stuff

3. think about what's possible now that was not possible 10 years ago and take advantage of it

4. appreciate the power you have to change the future

5. be adaptable to change: treat passion not as a destination but as the fuel; follow the opportunities, not just your dreams.
