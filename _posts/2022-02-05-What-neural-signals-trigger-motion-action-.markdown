A very interesting paper on what triggers action. The authors find that it is not just the strength (firing rate) of the incoming signal, but more critically the temporal stability of that incoming signal that triggers movement/action.

Population temporal structure supplements the rate code during sensorimotor transformations
Sensorimotor transformations are mediated by premotor brain networks where individual neurons represent sensory, cognitive, and movement-related infor…


Summary from the paper: 

• Population code supports temporal multiplexing during sensorimotor processing

• Temporal structure is unstable during sensation and stable during action

• Patterned microstimulation causally discriminates stable and unstable codes

• Network models provide basis for differential integration of temporal structure
