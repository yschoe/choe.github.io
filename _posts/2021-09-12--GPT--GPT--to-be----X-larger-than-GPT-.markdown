OpenAI was born to tackle the challenge of achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI) — an AI capable of doing anything a human can do.

Such a technology would change the world as we know it. It could benefit us all if used adequately but could become the most devastating weapon in the wrong hands. That’s why OpenAI took over this quest. To ensure it’d benefit everyone evenly: “Our goal is to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole.”

However, the magnitude of this problem makes it arguably the single biggest scientific enterprise humanity has put its hands upon. Despite all the advances in computer science and artificial intelligence, no one knows how to solve it or when it’ll happen.
