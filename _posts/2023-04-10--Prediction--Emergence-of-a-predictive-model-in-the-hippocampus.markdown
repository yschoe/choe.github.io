This looks very interesting!

From the highlights:

Mice formed a cognitive model by integrating previous training experiences

Mice used their model to predict the solutions to novel problems

Accurate predictions facilitated learning; inaccurate predictions delayed learning

Mice with accurate predictions engaged a reliable hippocampal state during learning
