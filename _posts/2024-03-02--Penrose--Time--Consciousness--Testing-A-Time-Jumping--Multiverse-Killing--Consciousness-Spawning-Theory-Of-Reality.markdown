An intriguing article on Roger Penrose's ideas about consciousness and physical reality (quantum and classical), and the role of gravity.

The idea is summarized like this: 

1) gravity causes [quantum] wave function collapse

2) the collapse involves retro-activity

3) consciousness comes out of this process

I'm not a fan of this kind of theory, but this article is the best summary of the idea I've read so far.
