Interesting result from neuroscience! Reward prediction in the brain is not too new. Got to find out what's new about this new result.

Neurobiologists take an unexpected detour to decode decision-making

by Anastasia Gorelova, University of Pittsburgh

In a paper published in Nature Neuroscience last week, University of Pittsburgh researchers described how reward signals in the brain are modulated by uncertainty. Dopamine signals are intertwined with reward learning; they teach the brain which cues or actions predict the best rewards. New findings from the Stauffer lab at Pitt School of Medicine indicate that dopamine signals also reflect the certainty surrounding reward predictions.

In short, dopamine signals might teach the brain about the likelihood of getting a reward.
