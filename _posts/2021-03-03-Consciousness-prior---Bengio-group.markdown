Interesting papers from the Bengio group.

 Note: When Bengio says "conscious", he means "conscious, as in conscious and deliberate effort", not "I feel like this or that kind of conscious". See our publications on consciousness: [/pub_topic/#Predictive](/pub_topic/#Predictive).

Yoshua Bengio 

Two new papers from my group & collaborators on system 2 architectures, led by Anirudh Goyal, to exploit attention, sparsity and bottlenecks of communication to favour modularity, systematic generalization and out-of-distribution generalization by exploiting inductive biases inspired by human conscious processing (you can check this earlier paper [https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.15091](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.15091) for an overview of these inductive biases).

#1: Coordination Among Neural Modules Through a Shared Global Workspace, [https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01197](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01197)

#2: Neural Production Systems, [https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01937](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01937)

These all derive from the early inspiration and vision of my 'consciousness prior' paper from 2017: [https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.08568.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.08568.) We have learned a lot since then, of course, but I believe this is just the beginning of a significant turn in the style of deep learning to achieve the flexibility and generalization power which conscious processing provides to humans. Self-attention and transformers were just the beginning of a great adventure. Congrats Anirudh Goyal for the amazing progress.
