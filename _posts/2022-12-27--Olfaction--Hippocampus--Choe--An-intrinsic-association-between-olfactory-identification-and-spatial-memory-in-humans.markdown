This is a very interesting paper on how olfactory identification and spatial memory are intrinsically associated in humans. (HT: June Hahn)



In our over 10 year old paper (below), we discussed this possibility, drawing parallels between the olfactory system (as external memory) and hippocampus (as internal memory), and their shared genetic/evolutionary origin, proximity, and characteristics (such as neurogenesis). See the introduction and the discussion.
