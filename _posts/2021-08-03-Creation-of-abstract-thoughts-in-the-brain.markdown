This looks very interesting. It would be interesting to consider this neuroscience finding with the ML paper I shared recently:  "Reward is Enough".

From the news article: 

"In essence, the brain system that normally tracks economic value becomes very active and ‘talks’ to the system that processes visual information. These value signals, much decried as the basis for marketing strategies, actually serve a crucial aspect of our intelligence. Value is used by the brain to select information and create mental abstractions."
