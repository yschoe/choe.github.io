Open-endedness is an intriguing topic (Ken Stanley, my former lab mate at UT Austin, presents this idea quite eloquently). The tool construction and tool use research in our lab is strongly in line with this: more complex tools can lead to higher intelligence, that can lead to yet more complex tools, etc. etc. ad infinitum.
