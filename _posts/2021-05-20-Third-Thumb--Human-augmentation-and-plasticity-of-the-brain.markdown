Adding a controllable third thumb can alter your brain's representation of your hands. 

This is a very interesting contraption, where the flexing and rotating of the third thumb is controlled via blue tooth link to the actuators put in your shoes (pressure sensors on the toes). Here's the original video about this that appeared in 2018. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1TkiN309_4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i1TkiN309_4)

Also look at the human augmentation projects by Stelarc (performance artist), especially, his third hand project: [http://stelarc.org/?catID=20265](http://stelarc.org/?catID=20265)
