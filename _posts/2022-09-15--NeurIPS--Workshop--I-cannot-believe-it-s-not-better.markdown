This looks like a fun workshop! "I cannot believe it's not better"! If you had a great idea and ran an experiment which gave poor results, AND if you tried to figure out (and did figure out) why it did not work, this is a workshop for you. :-) 



Quote:



We solicit contributions which explicitly formulate a hypothesis related to deep learning or its applications (based on first principles or prior work), and then empirically falsify it through experiments. We further encourage submissions to go a layer deeper and investigate the causes of an initial idea not working as expected. This workshop will showcase how negative results offer important learning opportunities for deep learning researchers, possibly far greater than the incremental improvements found in conventional machine learning papers!
