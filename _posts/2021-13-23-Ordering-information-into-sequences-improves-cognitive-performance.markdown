An article about a very interesting recent publication in "Neuron". What's interesting is that ordering information into sequences improves cognitive performance, and that the information is distributed across a larger population of neurons. Working memory, sequence processing, abstractions, all seem to be highly related. 


### quote 

Traditionally, studies of neural coding—which transforms electrical impulses from the neurons into memories, knowledge, decisions, and actions—have focused on selective responses of single neurons. The team demonstrated the shortcomings of such an approach by designing a task to probe changes in the prefrontal cortex that result in improved cognitive performance. The task allowed the subjects to use a mnemonic (or memory aid) strategy to order information into a sequence.
“We found that subjects spontaneously generated different selection patterns, including routine sequences, to decrease the working memory demands of the task,” said the senior author.
