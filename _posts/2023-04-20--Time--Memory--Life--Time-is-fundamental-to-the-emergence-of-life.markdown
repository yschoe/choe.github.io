This is very interesting! Time and memory as a key contributor to the complexity of life. 

The authors propose "assembly thoery", with which they state that the minimum number of steps needed to a complex molecular artifact to be constructed (the "assembly index") is higher than 15 for most things with life. To construct such artifacts, you need time and memory.
