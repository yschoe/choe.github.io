A very interesting talk by Justin Wood on: Radical empiricism: The origins of knowledge as a mini-evolution.

What knowledge is innate, and what is learned? Wood experiments with animals (new born chicks and fish larvae) and AI agents in a controlled virtual-reality environment to investigate learning of various concepts such as invariant object recognition, visual binding, object parsing, motion perception, object permanence, invariant face recognition. etc.
