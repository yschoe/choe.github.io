A very interesting paper on tool use.



Call, J. (2013). Three ingredients for becoming. <i>Tool use in animals: Cognition and ecology</i>, 3-20. 



The three ingredients are:

1. Information hoarding
1. Information recombination/restructuring
1. Object manipulation 



Here are some thoughts:

1. Each of these can influence the others in an organic way. Understanding this kind of interaction may be the key.
1. Implications on reinforcement learning, and relation to intrinsic motivation.
