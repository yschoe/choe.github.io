A great talk on the evolution of consciousnes by Nicholas Humphrey. The talk is based on his latest book "Sentience: The Invention of Consciousness" (HT: Jeong-Kyu Han) 

I read his first book "A History of the Mind" in 2005 and was greatly influenced by his ideas (the book itself was published in 1992). See comments below for more on my related papers, etc.

Here's a short paper that touches upon various aspects related to Humphrey's talk.
