Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays!

Video archive from the AI debate #2 :

Some interesting points:

Feifei Li's recent turn to sensorimotor processing research. She's famous for her work in computer vision and the ImageNet challenge, but her recent work is on robot control, etc., emphasizing the importance of the motor system.

Ken Stanley (my friend and lab mate from grad school days) talks about open-ended innovation (which I've mentioned several times, in relation to tool construction and tool-intelligence co-evolution as a means to achieve this). His talk is short but there are lots of interesting though-provoking ideas.

A question from the audience after the 1st session: "How do you deal with new concepts/random variables? This is a very important question, but the panelists did not seem to understand the intention of the question and the provided answers were off the mark.
