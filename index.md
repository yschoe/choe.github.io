I am a professor in the Department of Computer Science and 
Engineering at Texas A&amp;M University. My research is broadly in computational neuroscience, brain imaging and analysis, neuroevolution, and neural networks (deep learning). 
I am especially interested in the temporal aspects of brain function (delay, internal brain dynamics, prediction, consciousness), sensorimotor learning and grounding (visual, tactile, proprioceptive, semantics, meaning), agent-environment interaction (including tool construction and tool use), and evolution of brain structure and function.
