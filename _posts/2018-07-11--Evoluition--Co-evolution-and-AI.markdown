HSIAO-WUEN HON ON CO-EVOLUTION OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND HUMAN INTELLIGENCE



Throughout history, human beings have developed tools and technologies which help civilizations evolve and grow. Computers, and by extension, artificial intelligence, has played important roles in that continuum of technologies. Recently artificial intelligence has garnered much interest and discussion. In this talk, I will describe areas such as computer vision and data mining where artificial intelligence has demonstrated human like capabilities. I will also talk about how human can excel in the areas of creativity and judgment. As artificial intelligence are tools that can enhance human capability, a sound understanding of what the technology can and cannot do is also necessary to ensure their appropriate use.
