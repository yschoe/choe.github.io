A new article by Moore et al. (senior author Dmitri Chklovskii) argues that neurons are more than a feedforward, input-output transformer. It is an effective feedback controller.

quote : "This study extends current normative models, which primarily optimize prediction, by conceptualizing neurons as optimal feedback controllers. We posit that neurons, especially those beyond early sensory areas, steer their environment toward a specific desired state through their output. "

Chklovskii's lab has published many papers regarding the fundamental principles of neural function, such as wiring length minimization, cortical rewiring and information storage, etc.
