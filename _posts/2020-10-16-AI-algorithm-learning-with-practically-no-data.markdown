Karen 珂灵 Hao shared a link to the group: Artificial Intelligence & Deep Learning.


My latest for MIT Technology Review covers one of the most fascinating papers I've read this year, introducing a new technique that would allow AI to train on very little data. So little in fact that the model learns to recognize *more* objects than the number of data points it's trained on. Aka: "less than one"-shot learning.

My Friday gift to all of my fellow nerds.
