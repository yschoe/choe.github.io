Word meaning in minds and machines

Brenden M. Lake, Gregory L. Murphy : [https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01766](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.01766)



### Choe comments:

Also see the concept of language game by famous philosopher Wittgenstein:
A language-game (German: Sprachspiel) is a philosophical concept developed by Ludwig Wittgenstein, referring to simple examples of language use and the actions into which the language is woven. Wittgenstein argued that a word or even a sentence has meaning only as a result of the “rule” of the “game” being played. Depending on the context, for example, the utterance “Water!” could be an order, the answer to a question, or some other form of communication.
