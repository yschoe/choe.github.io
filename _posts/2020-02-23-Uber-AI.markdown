UBER AI lab's generative teaching network (GTN) : [https://eng.uber.com/generative-teaching-networks/](https://eng.uber.com/generative-teaching-networks/)
Basic idea: build deep neural networks that generate synthetic data and learn, so that good architecture can be found fast before training on real data.
Jeff Clune, Ken Stanley et al.
