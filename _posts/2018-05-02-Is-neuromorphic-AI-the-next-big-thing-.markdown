COGNITIVE COMPUTING: Is neuromorphic AI the next big thing?




##quote



Intelligent computers do not operate on a level playing field with the human brain for many reasons. Newborn humans (and other animals) have learning structures that have evolved through many millennia, while computers are starting from scratch. Even the developers of the most sophisticated neuromorphic systems do not claim to model the brain in its entirety or simulate the complex neurotransmitters that modulate brain functions. However, those systems have demonstrated the potential to provide greater transparency and flexibility than current cognitive systems, and they bear watching over the near and long term.
