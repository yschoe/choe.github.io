Montezuma’s Revenge Solved by Go-Explore, a New Algorithm for Hard-Exploration Problems (Sets Records on Pitfall, Too)

By Adrien Ecoffet



Kenneth O. Stanley and Jeff Clune were co-senior authors.



### quote 



Today we introduce Go-Explore, a new family of algorithms capable of achieving scores over 2,000,000 on Montezuma’s Revenge and scoring over 400,000 on average! Go-Explore reliably solves the entire game, meaning all three unique levels, and then generalizes to the nearly-identical subsequent levels (which only differ in the timing of events and the score on the screen). We have even seen it reach level 159!
