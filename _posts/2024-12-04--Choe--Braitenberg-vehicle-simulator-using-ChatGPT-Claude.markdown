Wrote a Braitenberg Vehicle simulator using Claude and ChatGPT.

Red: repulsed by light; Green: attracted by light; Yellow Circles: light bulb;  The vehicles can also have light bulbs on them. 

With these simple, deterministic agents, some very interesting behaviors emerge. In the beginning of the video, the Red ones  form a tight orbit, repulused by the lights. The Green ones orbit around the light sources. When the light source on the vehicles are turned on, the Red ones diverge from each other, repulsed by the other Red ones' light. Later on, the vehicle lights are turned off, and they all go back to the original behavior. Source code in the link below.
