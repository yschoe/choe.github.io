Interesting paper on how diversity in neural response property can lead to faster learning, and need fewer neurons to achieve the same performance.

Imperial researchers have found that variability between brain cells might speed up learning and improve the performance of the brain and future AI.

The new study found that by tweaking the electrical properties of individual cells in simulations of brain networks, the networks learned faster than simulations with identical cells.
