A very interesing essay on how evolution of modules may have led to intelligence.

### Modular cognition

"Powerful tricks from computer science and cybernetics show how evolution ‘hacked’ its way to intelligence from the bottom up"


* Michael Levin is the Vannevar Bush Chair and Distinguished Professor of Biology at Tufts University in Massachusetts, where he directs the Allen Discovery Center and the Tufts Center for Regenerative and Developmental Biology.

* Rafael Yuste is professor of biological sciences and neuroscience, co-director of the Kavil Institute for Brain Science, director of the NeuroTechnology Center and chair of the NeuroRights Foundation at Columbia University.

Some quotes:

> Modularity means that the stakes for testing out mutations are reasonably low

> Analysing the brain by looking at a single neuron is like trying to understand a movie from an isolated pixel

> We call on biologists to embrace the intentional stance: treating circuits and cells as problem-solving agents
