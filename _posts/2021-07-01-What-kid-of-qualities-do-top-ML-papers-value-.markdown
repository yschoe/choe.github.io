What kind of qualities do top ML papers "value"?

This is an interesting paper that studied 100 most highly cited papers in ICML and NeurIPS and discusses what the authors of these top papers value the most.

They find that performance, generalization, efficiency, researcher understanding, novelty, and building on previous work are the most values qualities.

Other findings: in 2008/2009, 21% of the papers had corporate affiliated authors, but in 2018/2019, this skyrocketed to 71%. Maybe this could be due to the increasing collaboration between academia and the industry.
