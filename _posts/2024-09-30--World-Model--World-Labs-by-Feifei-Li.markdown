Fei Fei Li's startup "World Labs" aiming to build Large World Models, emphasizing spatial intelligence over LLM's verbal intelligence. This could get LLMs closer to meaningful AI. 

Some text from their about page: 

Toward this goal, World Labs will develop spatially intelligent Large World Models (LWMs) that can understand and reason about the 3D world from images and other modalities. Over time, we expect to train increasingly powerful models with broader capabilities that can be applied in a variety of domains, working alongside people.

Initially we will focus on generating 3D worlds without limits - creating and editing virtual spaces complete with physics, semantics, and control. We hope this will unlock new capabilities for creative users and professionals such as artists, designers, developers, and engineers. It will also allow anyone to imagine and create their own worlds, expanding the potential of generative AI from 2D images and videos to 3D worlds.
